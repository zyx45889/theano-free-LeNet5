# theano-free-LeNet5
summer course in BMI lab "Getting Started: Practice Machine Learning Algorithms in Computer Vision" by Prof. Yueming Wang

Construct LeNet5 step by step from scratch in two weeks. Any deep learning package like theano or torch is not allowed in the course. The only tool that can be use in the code is Numpy.

All the code in python is under the directory "code", and the directory "material" stores course slides.

### Lecture1

Introduction of opencv and HoG

### Lecture2

logistic regression. Rewrite mnist LR code(in theano) into theano-free style and use the code to do basketball recognition.

### Lecture3

SVM. Use SVM to do basketball recognition.

### Lecture4

MLP. Rewrite mnist MLP code(in theano) into theano-free style and use the code to do basketball recognition.

### Lecture5

CNN. Rewrite mnist CNN code(in theano)(actually LeNet5) into theano-free style and use the code to do basketball recognition.
